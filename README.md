# FluidEnabler Beta 2
Enables SpringBoard's Fluid UI for non-iPhone X devices.

## Installation
Copy both ```FluidEnabler.dylib``` and ```FluidEnabler.plist``` to the 
```usr/lib/SBInject``` directory and using the terminal, run ```killall SpringBoard```.

## Uninstallation
Remove both ```FluidEnabler.dylib``` and ```FluidEnabler.plist``` from the
```usr/lib/SBInject``` directory and using the terminal, run ```killall SpringBoard```.

## Upcoming Features
- Fix button mapping issues (current implementation uses iPhone X mapping which leads to some gestures not working)
- Fix status bar lag and offset when opening Control Center from the top right of screen
- Add proper iPhone X status bar support
- Add PreferenceLoader settings to toggle features on and off
